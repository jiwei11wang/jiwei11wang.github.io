**I am currently looking for a funded PhD position starting 2026**

Hi, I am a M2 student in [Chemistry & Life Sciences](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/formation/parcours-chimie-sdv/) at Université Paris Sciences et Lettres, and I'll graduate at summer 2026. 

My research interests mainly evlove around 3 domians: Statistical Physics, Complex Networks, and Data-driven Modeling.

From January 2026, I am joining  [Prof. Francesca MASTROGIUSEPPE](https://fmastrogiuseppe.github.io/)'s theoretical neuroscience group at SISSA (Trieste, Italy) for my master thesis about dynamical regime of multi-area brain circuits. Back to my 6-month internship during 2025, I was supervised by [Prof. David LACOSTE](https://dlacoste22.github.io/) at ESPCI (Paris, France), where we theoretically derived a intrinsical bound on growth rate for chemical reaction networks based on network topology. And all above starts from a bachelor degree in material chemistry at 西北大学 Northwest University (Xi'an, China), where I did some work in protein folding with molecular dynamics under the guidiance of [Prof. 陈涛 Tao CHEN](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Tao-Chen-82541369).
