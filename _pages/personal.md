I'm an anime and movie fan, I like analyzing them, and also want to produce them myself one day, I used to read books about lens design during my bachelor, and I am currently reading the book: "Imaginary Signifier - Psychoanalysis and the Cinema" by Christian Metz, student of Roland Barthes. I mention this becasuse Roland Barthes is my favorite philosopher (or writer?), started from his books, I am also intrigued by philosophy and sociology, I am also reading the book "The Consumer Society" by Jean Baudrillard at the mean time.

Started from 2 years ago, I keep doing regular strength training and fitness about 5-8 hours a week. 

I also engaged with Japanese literature (around 1900 - 1980) a lot during high school and the first 2 years of my bachelor, for which I also minored in Japanese for 2 years (why I speak some Japanese), but quitted half year before getting the degree.

Dated before high school, I trained in trumpt for 5 years, and Go (the chinese board game) for 8 years.
